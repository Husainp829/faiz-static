            <p class="text-info">What is Faiz ul Mawaid il Burhaniyah ?</p>
            <p>Faiz ul Mawaid il Burhaniyah is the faiz of our beloved Bawasheb Moula<strong> Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin (RA)</strong> ane aapna noore nazar ane Mansoos
               <strong> Syedna Aali Qadr Mufaddal Bhaisaheb Saifuddin (TUS)</strong>.</p>
            <p>This faiz is in the tradition of Hudaat Kiraam feeding mumineen, just as <strong> Moulana Ali (AS)</strong> used to feed mumineen in Kufa through Imamain Aqdasain, today His Dai is sending the same barakaat to every mumin's home on the hands of His Mansoos.</p>
            <p class="text-info">How much is the hub ?</p>
            <p>The minimum hub unit for each person is Rs 1700. The hub that you pay is 'jamarwane'. It is the ehsaan of bawasaheb Moula that by giving hub we are able to get the sawaab of feeding mumineen every single day. The more hub you do araz, the more sawab of Itaam ut Ta'am (jaman jamarwanu). Let us know the hub you are willing to contribute.</p>
            <p>The hub is due before the start of every hijri month.</p>
            <p>The hub is not for your thaali, you can never pay for the jaman, as Moula jamare che, it is for 'jamarwane'.</p>
            <p class="text-info">Who can register for students faiz, and why is it different from the local jamaat faiz ?</p>
            <p>Students faiz is for students or working professionals from outside Poona. If you are permanently settled in Poona or are a family, please contact your local faiz for starting a thaali and do not register here.</p>
            <p>Students faiz is a hasanat of Moula's (TUS) Poona safar mubarak in 1433 H. It was started to involve students in this azeem khidmat and also to cater specifically to their needs. Hence it is every student's Faiz, so please come forward with your views, feedbacks, and help in any kind to make this Faiz as per Moula(TUS)s wishes and gain His happiness.</p>
            <p class="text-info">What is a half / full thaali ?</p>
            <p>A half thaali is meant for a single person, while a full thaali is meant for two persons eating two times. Both thaalis provide sufficient quantity for two meals.</p>
            <p class="text-info">How much is the quantity ?</p>
            <p>A full thaali consists of 10 rotis, 2 containers of rice, 1 tarkari for roti, and one tarkari for rice. A half thaali consists of 5 rotis, 1 container of rice and also the two tarkaris, however the size of the serving is smaller. If you need more/less quantity contact us <a href="#contactUs">here</a>.</p>
            <p class="text-info">What are the pickup timings ?</p>
            <p>Pickup timings are between 10:30 PM to 2:00 PM</p>
            <p class="text-info">How much does the transport cost ?</p>
            <p>The transport cost is either Rs 200 or Rs 300 per thaali depending upon the distance. This is payable directly to the transporter and is not included in the faiz hub.</p>
            <p class="text-info">How and where can I pay the hub ?</p>
            <p>You can pay hub in person at the pick up address given <a href="#contactUs">below</a>, or you can give it to your transporter in an envolope with your name written on it. Please remember to collect your receipt in both the cases. If you do not receive the receipt please email us.</p>
